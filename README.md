# pokemonMatchupFinder
This is a Pokemon battle matchup finder. It takes an input opponent, and outputs the best potential matchup, based on standard form and base stats

This is the very (very) bare bones of this app. Currently the user inputs an opponent Pokemon via the terminal. The app then searches all pokemon, and 
outputs the best mon, based on standard form and base stats, to fight the opponent. This is v0.1 - the functionality is there but its ugly as sin!

## Next steps 

- Use SQL database for pokemon queries to speed up matching (currently one via API requests)
- Web interface for users to select opponent, and then enter into detailed records of suggest mon / mons
- Allow the user to filter output pokemon based on what mons they have in their posession
